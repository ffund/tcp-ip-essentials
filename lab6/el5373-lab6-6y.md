## TCP bulk file transfer

In the previous exercises, we observed an interactive data transfer, where the data to send was generated by an interactive process. 

That connection was *application-limited* - the rate at which data is transferred across the connection is mainly limited by the rate at which the application produces data to send. With the interactive application, data was placed in the send buffer intermittently, at a low rate.

Next, we'll look at a *bulk* data transfer, where we send a large volume of data across the network - for example, a large file. Under these circumstances, the application has a large volume of data to place in the send buffer, so the connection will not be application-limited. In that case, the rate at which data is transferred across the connection may be limited by either the congestion window (CWND) or the receive window (RWND):

* The connection will be CWND-limited if there are so many bytes "in flight" - sent but not yet acknowledged - that if we sent another segment, the number of bytes "in flight" would exceed the congestion window. The application may keep putting data into the socket send buffer as long as it has free space, but the operating system won't send it until some of the data "in flight" is acknowledged.
* The connection will be RWND-limited if the receiver does not have enough space in its receive buffer to accept new segments. The application at the sender side may keep putting data into the socket send buffer as long as it has free space, but the operating system won't send it until the advertised window size of the receiver indicates free space in the receive buffer.

In this exercise, we'll explore those circumstances further. We'll also have a chance to see what happens when an established connection is broken, and then re-connected.


### Setup

First, we need to get the bulk data to send. On romeo, run

```
wget -O file.txt http://www.gutenberg.org/files/100/100-0.txt
```

to retrieve a file from the Internet and save it as `file.txt`. 

Also download the Python scripts we'll use to transfer bulk data. These scripts use the same socket commands you're familiar with from the previous exercise.

On romeo, run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/master/lab6/file-sender.py -O file-sender.py
```

On juliet, run

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/master/lab6/file-receiver.py -O file-receiver.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/master/lab6/file-receiver-slow.py -O file-receiver-slow.py
```

Next, configure the router as a 1 Mbps bottleneck, with a buffer size of 0.1 MB, in both directions. On the router, run

```
sudo tc qdisc del dev eth1 root  
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 root handle 1: htb default 3  
sudo tc class add dev eth1 parent 1: classid 1:3 htb rate 1Mbit  
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 parent 1:3 handle 3: bfifo limit 0.1MB

sudo tc qdisc del dev eth2 root  
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth2 root handle 1: htb default 3  
sudo tc class add dev eth2 parent 1: classid 1:3 htb rate 1Mbit  
sudo tc qdisc add dev eth2 parent 1:3 handle 3: bfifo limit 0.1MB  
```

Don't worry if you see a message in the output that says

```
RTNETLINK answers : No such file or directory  
```

This is normal, and not a problem!


As bulk data traverses the network, it goes through multiple buffers (also called queues): the socket send buffer on the sender, the egress buffer on intermediate routers, and the socket receive buffer on the receiver. We'll monitor all of these buffers continuously throughout the experiment.

In a Linux terminal on both romeo and juliet, run

```
watch -n 0.1 ss -t -o state established -ni src 10.10.0.0/16
```

to monitor the send and receive queues in real time.

On the router, to monitor the egress queue that buffers traffic from romeo to juliet, identify the name of the interface that is connected to the same LAN as juliet. Then, run

```
watch -n 0.1 tc -s qdisc show dev IFACE
```

where in place of `IFACE`, substitute the name of that interface.

Leave these running throughout the experiments in this section

### Exercise: CWND-limited bulk file transfer

First, we'll see what happens when data is sent at a rate faster than the network can transfer it. 

On romeo, run

```
sudo tcpdump  -s 80 -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-tcp-bulk-cwnd.pcap  
```

to save the packet headers to a file.


Now, we'll transfer the `file.txt` file from romeo to juliet.

On juliet, run

```
python3 file-receiver.py
```

Then, on romeo, run


```
python3 file-sender.py
```

Watch the queues as you transfer the file, and take a screenshot of the queue status while the file transfer is ongoing. Which queues appear to have data waiting in them? 

(If the file transfer happened too fast, you can try it again! Just stop the `tcpdump` and the Python processes with Ctrl+C, wait some time for the `TIME_WAIT` state to end, and repeat the steps above.)

Once the file transfer is complete, on juliet, run


```
cat file.txt
```

to verify the received file contents.

Use Ctrl+C to stop the `tcpdump`, and then transfer the packet capture file to your laptop using `scp`.

Open the packet capture with Wireshark, and use the `tcp` display filter to view only the TCP traffic. In the Wireshark menu, choose Statistics > TCP Stream Graphs > Time Sequence (tcptrace). This should open a figure similar to the following:

![tcptrace plot for CWND-limited bulk file transfer.](tcptrace-cwnd.svg)

You can use your mouse to zoom in on different parts of the plot, and the "Reset" button to reset the zoom. 

In this image, TCP sequence numbers are plotted against time. 

* Each transmitted packet is shown as a vertical blue line, where the bottom of line is at the (relative) sequence number of that packet, and the height of the line is the TCP segment length of that packet. Since the sequence number is incremented by one for each byte sent, this vertical blue line shows the "range" of sequence numbers included in the packet. When you click on the center of one of the vertical blue lines, it will highlight that packet in the Wireshark packet list pane.
* The green line shows the "calculated" receive window size. This is the receive window size plus the last ACK number, i.e. what is the largest sequence number the sender can send without being RWND-limited? The difference between the green line and the blue transmitted packets shows us how much space the receiver has in its buffer.
* The brown line shows the ACK number. The difference between the brown line and the blue transmitted packets shows us the number of bytes "in flight". The sender is not allowed to have more bytes "in flight" than the CWND.
* SACKs are shown as red vertical lines. The bottom and top of the line shows the block of sequence numbers acknowledged by the SACK.

**Lab report**: The [file sending application](file-sender.py) passes blocks of data with size 4096 bytes as an argument to the `send` socket API call. Look at the TCP segment length in the TCP header of the data segments from romeo to juliet. Is the data transferred in 4096 B blocks? Can data from different 4096 B blocks (different `send` calls) end up in the same TCP segment? Explain. Compare and contrast your answer to this question with the equivalent UDP behavior.

**Lab report**: Does the number of data segments differ from that of their acknowledgements? Find an ACK that acknowledges more than one data segment. Also show the ACK immediately before this one. How can you tell that this ACK acknowledges more than one data segment? How many data segments are acknowledged by the ACK you have selected, and how many bytes of data?


**Lab report**: When segments are dropped in a TCP connection, the sender retransmits those segments.

* Find and show a retransmission in your packet capture. Also find and show the initial transmission of this segment. Note the time and the sequence number of each packet. How long did it take for the TCP sender to realize that the segment was lost, and retransmit it?
* Did the sender learn that the segment was dropped because it received a duplicate ACK? If so, show the duplicate ACK *and* the first ACK, with the same ACK number. What transmitted segment did the receiver send the first ACK in response to, and what transmitted segment did the receiver send the duplicate ACK in response to? Explain.
* When sending a duplicate ACK, the receiver can use *selective acknowledgement* to inform the sender about subsequent segments (after the missing segment) that have arrived successfully, so the sender need retransmit only the segment that was lost and not the subsequent segments. The hosts in our connection should be configured to use SACK by default. Show the SACK TCP option in the duplicate ACK. Which segments were received successfully after the missing segment?

**Lab report**: On the `tcptrace` plot (from Wireshark) for this bulk data transfer, zoom in on a 10-second interval in the middle of the file transfer. For some instance of time in this interval, annotate your image to indicate 1) the (approximate) sequence number of the current segment, 2) the (approximate) ACK nummber of the most recently received ACK, 3) the (approximate) number of bytes "in flight", 4) the (approximate) maximum segment number this host can send without exceeding the other host's advertised receive window size, and 5) the (approximate) free space in the other host's receive buffer, in bytes.


**Lab report**: Show a screenshot of the queue status on both hosts in middle of the bulk file transfer. Annotate the screenshot; circle the socket send buffer on the TCP sender and the receive queue on the TCP receiver. How can you tell that the connection is *not* application-limited? How can you tell that the connection is *not* RWND-limited?



### Exercise: RWND-limited bulk file transfer

Next, we'll see what happens when data is sent at a rate faster than the receiving application can process it. 

On romeo, run

```
sudo tcpdump  -s 80 -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-tcp-bulk-rwnd.pcap  
```

to save the packet headers to a file.


Now, we'll transfer the `file.txt` file from romeo to juliet.

On juliet, run the application that removes data from the receive buffer very slowly - 

```
python3 file-receiver-slow.py
```

Then, on romeo, run


```
python3 file-sender.py
```

Watch the queues as you transfer the file, and take a screenshot of the queue status while the file transfer is ongoing. Which queues appear to have data waiting in them? 

(If the file transfer happened too fast, you can try it again! Just stop the `tcpdump` and the Python processes with Ctrl+C, wait some time for the `TIME_WAIT` state to end, and repeat the steps above.)

Once the file transfer is complete, on juliet, run


```
cat file.txt
```

to verify the received file contents.

Use Ctrl+C to stop the `tcpdump`, and then transfer the packet capture file to your laptop using `scp`. Use Wireshark to visualize the Time/Sequence tcptrace plot.

**Lab report**: On the `tcptrace` plot (from Wireshark) for this bulk data transfer, zoom in on a 5-second interval in the middle of the file transfer. Explain how this image shows that the connection is RWND-limited.

**Lab report**: how a screenshot of the queue status on both hosts in middle of the bulk file transfer. Annotate the screenshot; circle the socket send buffer on the TCP sender and the receive queue on the TCP receiver. How can you tell that the connection is *not* application-limited? How can you tell that the connection is probably RWND-limited, not CWND-limited?

**Lab report**: When a connection is RWND-limited, the receiver may sometimes send an ACK indicating that the receive buffer has no space available (i.e. Zero Window). Find one of these in your packet capture. You are also likely to see some ACKs in your packet capture that are TCP Window Update ACKs. Find one of these in your packet capture, and also find the ACK that is sent by the receiver just *before* the TCP Window Update. Compare the ACK number and the advertised window size in these two ACKs - the TCP Window Update and the ACK immediately preceding it. What is the purpose of the TCP Window Update? Does it acknowledge previously unacknowledged segments?



### Exercise: interrupted bulk file transfer

Finally, we'll see what happens when a TCP data transfer is interrupted because the connection is broken. 

On romeo, run

```
sudo tcpdump  -s 80 -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-tcp-bulk-interrupted.pcap  
```

to save the packet headers to a file.


Now, we'll transfer the `file.txt` file from romeo to juliet.

On juliet, run application that receives the file from the network - 

```
python3 file-receiver.py
```

Then, on romeo, run


```
python3 file-sender.py
```

While the file transfer is ongoing, break the connection between romeo and juliet - on the router, identify the name of the interface that is on the same LAN as *juliet*, and bring it down with


```
sudo ifconfig IFACE down
```

(substitute the correct interface name).

Wait for about three minutes. Watch the output of 

```
watch -n 0.1 ss -t -o state established -ni src 10.10.0.0/16
```


on romeo - as part of the output you'll see the current state of the timer that determines when to send the next retransmission, and what number retransmission this is.

After a few minutes, run

```
sudo ifconfig IFACE up
```

on the router to restore the connection. (Again, substitute the correct interface name.)

When the file transfer is complete, use Ctrl+C to stop the `tcpdump`, and then transfer the packet capture file to your laptop using `scp`.

**Lab report**: Find the part of the packet capture where the connection was broken.  Examine the time difference between successive retransmissions of the same segment. What is the maximum time between successive retransmissions of the same packet? Describe how the time intervals between successive retransmissions changes during the period when the connection was broken, and show evidence from your packet capture.
