## Cloudlab-specific instructions: Reserve resources

First, you will reserve a topology with four hosts and one router, and IP addresses as follows:

* romeo - 10.10.1.100
* juliet - 10.10.1.101
* hamlet - 10.10.1.102
* ophelia - 10.10.2.103
* router - 10.10.1.1 and 10.10.2.1

with netmask 255.255.255.0.

To reserve resources on Cloudlab, open this profile page:

Click "next", then select the Cloudlab project that you are part of and a Cloudlab cluster with available resources. (This experiment is compatible with any of the Cloudlab clusters.) Then click "next", and "finish".

Wait until all of the sources have turned green and have a small check mark in the top right corner of the "topology view" tab, indicating that they are fully configured and ready to log in. Then, click on "list view" to get SSH login details for the nodes.
