## Cloudlab-specific instructions: Reserve resources

For this experiment, we will use the topology illustrated here, with IP addresses as noted on the diagram and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 on each interface:

To reserve resources on Cloudlab, open this profile page:

https://www.cloudlab.us/p/nyunetworks/education?refspec=refs/heads/network_security

Click "next", then select the Cloudlab project that you are part of and a Cloudlab cluster with available resources. (This experiment is compatible with any of the Cloudlab clusters.) Then click "next", and "finish".

Wait until all of the sources have turned green and have a small check mark in the top right corner of the "topology view" tab, indicating that they are fully configured and ready to log in. Then, click on "list view" to get SSH login details for the nodes.
