# TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach

### Static routing

* Reserve resources: [on CloudLab](reserve-cloudlab.md), [on FABRIC](reserve-fabric.md)
* Exercises with IP address and subnet masks: [on CloudLab](routing-subnet-cloudlab.md), [on FABRIC](routing-subnet-fabric.md)
* Exercises with static routing between networks: [on CloudLab](routing-between-cloudlab.md), [on FABRIC](routing-between-fabric.md)
