## Operation of a basic Ethernet switch or bridge

In this experimental demonstration of the basic operation of a layer 2 switch/bridge, we will see:

* how to set up a layer 2 bridge on Linux,
* how a bridge or switch learns MAC addresses and updates its forwarding table, and how it forwards, filters, or floods a frame depending on the forwarding table,
* how a bridge or switch reduces collisions by separating each port into a separate collision domain.

It should take about 60-120 minutes to run this experiment.

### Background

An Ethernet switch or bridge relays Ethernet frames between devices connected to different _ports_. It thereby links multiple hosts (or smaller network segments each with multiple hosts) into a single connected network.

When a frame arrives at a switch or a bridge, the source address of the frame is noted. 

* If this address is not already in the forwarding table, a new entry is added, including the address and the port on which the frame was received, and an ageing timer is started for that entry. 
* If the address is already in the forwarding table, the ageing timer for that entry is restarted. If the port on which the frame was received is different (e.g. if the host has moved to a different port) then the entry is updated to reflect the new port.
 
The ageing timer is used to remove old entries from the forwarding table. When the "age" value for an entry in the table passes a given threshold, that entry is removed.

Then, the forwarding table is used to determine whether to forward, filter, or flood the frame, depending on its destination address:

* When the switch receives a frame that is destined for an address that is not in the table, the switch will _flood_ the frame out of all ports other than the port on which it arrived.
* If the destination address is in the table, and is known to be reachable on the same port that the frame was received on, the switch will _filter_ (drop) the frame. 
* Otherwise, the switch will _forward_ the frame out of the port corresponding to its destination address in the forwarding table.

Switches and bridges improve performance by partitioning the _collision domain_, the section of network within which frames collide (destructively) with one another when they are sent simultaneously. Only one host in a collision domain may transmit at a time, in order to avoid collisions. Thus, the total network capacity is shared among all hosts in a collision domain. With a learning switch or bridge, each port on a switch becomes its own collision domain, and so each network segment can separately support the full network capacity. 

### Set up the bridge

Use SSH to log in to the "bridge" node in your topology, and install the bridge software with:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install bridge-utils
```

Since a bridge operates at Layer 2, bridge interfaces should not have an IP address. On the bridge, flush the IP address from each of the four experiment interfaces (but be careful not to bring down the control interface):

```
sudo ip addr flush dev EXPIFACE1
sudo ip addr flush dev EXPIFACE2
sudo ip addr flush dev EXPIFACE3
sudo ip addr flush dev EXPIFACE4
```

Then, create a new bridge interface named `br0` with the command

```
sudo brctl addbr br0
```

And add the four experiment interfaces to the bridge:

```
sudo brctl addif br0 EXPIFACE1
sudo brctl addif br0 EXPIFACE2
sudo brctl addif br0 EXPIFACE3
sudo brctl addif br0 EXPIFACE4
```

Finally, we will bring "up" all of the interfaces:

```
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE1 up
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE2 up
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE3 up
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE4 up
sudo ip link set br0 up
```

At this point, you should be able to list the bridge ports with

```
brctl show br0
```

The output should look something like this:

```
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br0             8000.021e6b573974       no              EXPIFACE1
                                                        EXPIFACE2
                                                        EXPIFACE3
                                                        EXPIFACE4
```

You can also see the MAC addresses that the bridge is aware of, with 

```
brctl showmacs br0
```

For now, since no traffic has passed through the bridge, it will only know the four MAC addresses corresponding to the four local interfaces that are on this host (i.e. on the bridge):

```
port no	mac addr		is local?	ageing timer
  4	02:1e:6b:57:39:74	yes		   0.00
  1	02:34:7e:04:7b:4e	yes		   0.00
  2	02:97:e4:d3:aa:95	yes		   0.00
  3	02:cb:96:8d:5b:1f	yes		   0.00
```

but it won't know about any other nodes' addresses. (At this point, you can use `ip addr` to find the MAC address of each interface, then match with the output of the command above to determine the "port number" (1, 2, 3, 4) associated with each interface.)

> **Note**: On some versions of the Ubuntu operating system, you'll see each MAC address appear twice in the `brctl showmacs br0` output! This is OK.

Verify that all of the end hosts in the topology can reach one another through the bridge. On each of romeo, juliet, hamlet, and ophelia, run

```
ping -c 1 10.0.0.1
ping -c 1 10.0.0.2
ping -c 1 10.0.0.3
ping -c 1 10.0.0.4
```

Immediately afterwards, the bridge should be aware of every nodes' MAC address, and which port they are located on. The output of 

```
brctl showmacs br0
```

should show something like this:

```
port no	mac addr		is local?	ageing timer
  4	02:1e:6b:57:39:74	yes		   0.00
  1	02:34:7e:04:7b:4e	yes		   0.00
  1	02:5d:96:11:77:19	no		   1.86
  2	02:97:e4:d3:aa:95	yes		   0.00
  2	02:a0:6e:e0:58:93	no		   1.89
  3	02:cb:96:8d:5b:1f	yes		   0.00
  3	02:cd:b5:11:64:e2	no		   1.89
  4	02:da:4f:51:ac:c9	no		   1.86
```

Now, you can use `ip addr` on each of the hosts to find out its MAC address and determine which bridge port (1,2,3,4) each one is connected to.

As time passes without further traffic passing through the bridge, the values in the "ageing timer" column will increase. Once an entry ages past 300 seconds, it will be removed from the forwarding table. So, after 5 minutes with no traffic, the output of

```
brctl showmacs br0
```

again shows only the MAC addresses local to the bridge.

### Learning MAC addresses

Now, we will watch as MAC addresses are added to the forwarding table on the bridge. Start by verifying that the forwarding table contains _only_ local addresses:

```
brctl showmacs br0
```
and if not, wait for the non-local addresses to age out.

Then, run

```
bridge monitor fdb
```

on the bridge. This will show us new entries live, as they are added to or removed from the forwarding table.

On node-1, node-2, node-3, and node-4, we will use `tcpdump` to watch traffic on the interface connected to the bridge. Run

```
sudo tcpdump -n -e -i eth1
```

This will run `tcpdump` on the "eth1" interface (`-i eth1`), with the Ethernet headers showing (`-e`) and with IP addresses showing as numeric values, rather than hostnames (`-n`).

Then, in a second terminal on node-1, we will send some traffic to node-2:

```
ping -c 5 10.0.0.2
```

The results of this experiment are shown in the following video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xHH59_S-lX4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


In the output, we can see:

* As a frame from node-1 arrives at the switch, an entry for that host is added to the forwarding table on the bridge, indicated which switch port that MAC address is connected to:

```
02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 dev eth3 vlan 0  
```

* The first frame from node-1 is sent out of _all_ of the other bridge ports, because it is not yet known which bridge port the destination address (02:a0:6e:e0:58:93) is connected to. In the `tcpdump` output, we see an entry similar to the following on all three nodes:

```
17:02:37.531348 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 1, length 64
```

* node-2 sends a reply to the ping request. When this reply reaches the bridge, an entry is added to the forwarding table for node-2, indicated which switch port that MAC address is connected to:

```
02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 dev eth2 vlan 0 
```

* Since the location of node-1 is already known, the reply from node-2 (shown below) is only sent out the bridge port where node-1 is located. Therefore, the reply does _not_ appear in the `tcpdump` output on node-3 or node-4. We do see it in the `tcpdump` output on node-2, and if we were running `tcpdump` on node-1 we would see it there, too:

```
17:02:37.636918 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 1, length 64
```

* Since the location of node-2 is known, further ping requests (shown below) are only sent out the bridge port where node-2 is located. They therefore appear in the `tcpdump` output on node-2, but not on the other nodes:

```
17:02:38.638746 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 2, length 64
17:02:38.638776 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 2, length 64
17:02:39.640698 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 3, length 64
17:02:39.640728 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 3, length 64
17:02:40.642796 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 4, length 64
17:02:40.642833 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 4, length 64
17:02:41.644840 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 5, length 64
17:02:41.644866 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 5, length 64
```


### Effect of a smaller collision domain

Finally, we will observe how a switch or a bridge improves network performance by reducing the number of hosts in each collision domain. Only one host in a collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other hosts listen to the network in order to avoid collisions. Thus, the total network capacity is shared among all hosts on the collision domain.

To measure this effect, we will use `iperf`, a tool that estimates network capacity by trying to send data as quickly as possible over a link, and measuring the total data rate.

To install `iperf`, on each of node-1, node-2, node-3, and node-4, run

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install iperf
```

Then, run the `iperf` receiver application on node-3 and node-4:

```
iperf -s
```

Finally, we will run the `iperf` transmitter to send traffic to each of those. Try to start the two transmitters quickly, one after the other.

On node-1, run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -t 90
```

and on node-2, quickly run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90
```

After a couple of minutes, you should see messages on the two receiver instances, indicating the total data rate in kilobits per second, e.g.

```
[  4]  0.0-97.3 sec  9.88 MBytes   851 Kbits/sec
```

on one, and

```
[  4]  0.0-97.3 sec  9.88 MBytes   851 Kbits/sec
```

on the other.

Now, we will turn off MAC address learning on the bridge (by setting the ageing timeout to 0, so that all forwarding table entries expire immediately):

```
sudo brctl setageing br0 0
```

Without MAC address learning, all frames will be flooded on all ports, and all nodes will be in a single collision domain. The 1000 Kbps capacity will be shared between them.

The `iperf` receivers should still be running on node-3 and node-4. We will start the transmitters again, one after the other. On node-1, run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -t 90
```

and on node-2, quickly run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90
```

Now we can see from the measured data rate on each of the two receivers, that the 1000 Kbps link capacity is shared between the two traffic flows.
```
[  5]  0.0-150.8 sec  7.50 MBytes   417 Kbits/sec
```

on one, and

```
[  5]  0.0-130.8 sec  8.88 MBytes   569 Kbits/sec
```

on the other.

To restore MAC address learning, on the bridge run

```
sudo brctl setageing br0 300
```

This experiment is shown in the following video:

**Lab report**: Save the output of `ip addr` on each host and on the bridge, and also save the output of the `brctl showmacs br0` command when the bridge has seen the MAC addresses of all four hosts. Annotate these to draw a box or a circle around the MAC addresses on the experiment interfaces in the `ip addr` output, and to write the name of the host (or bridge) that the MAC address belongs to next to each line of the `brctl` output. Then, use this information to fill in a table showing the bridge configuration. For each bridge port (1, 2, 3, 4), indicate:

* which interface on the bridge - `EXPIFACE1`, `EXPIFACE2`, `EXPIFACE3`, `EXPIFACE4` - is on that port, and the MAC address of that interface.
* which host (romeo, juliet, hamlet, or ophelia) is on that port, and its MAC address

### Learning MAC addresses

Now, we will watch as MAC addresses are added to the forwarding table on the bridge. Start by verifying that the forwarding table contains _only_ local addresses:

```
brctl showmacs br0
```
and if not, wait for the non-local addresses to age out.

Then, run

```
bridge monitor fdb
```

on the bridge. This will show us new entries live, as they are added to or removed from the forwarding table.

On romeo, juliet, hamlet, and ophelia, we will use `tcpdump` to watch traffic on the interface connected to the bridge. Run

```
sudo tcpdump -n -e -i EXPIFACE1
```

This will run `tcpdump` on the "EXPIFACE1" interface (`-i EXPIFACE1`), with the Ethernet headers showing (`-e`) and with IP addresses showing as numeric values, rather than hostnames (`-n`).

Then, in a second terminal on romeo, we will send some traffic to juliet:

```
ping -c 5 10.0.0.2
```

In the output, we can see something like the following:

* As a frame from romeo arrives at the switch, an entry for that host is added to the forwarding table on the bridge, indicated which switch port that MAC address is connected to:

```
02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 dev eth3 vlan 0  
```

* The first frame from romeo is sent out of _all_ of the other bridge ports, because it is not yet known which bridge port the destination address (02:a0:6e:e0:58:93) is connected to. In the `tcpdump` output, we see an entry similar to the following on all three nodes:

```
17:02:37.531348 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 1, length 64
```

* juliet sends a reply to the ping request. When this reply reaches the bridge, an entry is added to the forwarding table for juliet, indicated which switch port that MAC address is connected to:

```
02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 dev eth2 vlan 0 
```

* Since the location of romeo is already known, the reply from juliet (shown below) is only sent out the bridge port where romeo is located. Therefore, the reply does _not_ appear in the `tcpdump` output on hamlet or ophelia. We do see it in the `tcpdump` output on juliet, and if we were running `tcpdump` on romeo we would see it there, too:

```
17:02:37.636918 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93 > 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.2 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP echo reply, id 2736, seq 1, length 64
```

* Since the location of juliet is known, further ping requests (shown below) are only sent out the bridge port where juliet is located. They therefore appear in the `tcpdump` output on juliet, but not on the other nodes:

```
17:02:38.638746 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 2736, seq 2, length 64

```

**Lab report**: Make an ordered list of the following six events:

  * the bridge learns the MAC address of romeo,
  * the bridge learns the MAC address of juliet,
  * romeo sends the first ping request (with seq 1) to juliet, 
  * juliet sends the first ping reply (with seq 1) to romeo,
  * juliet receives the first ping request (with seq 1) from romeo,
  * romeo receives the first ping reply (with seq 1) from juliet.

  (By "make an ordered list", I mean: note which event happened first, which happened second, etc.)

With each list entry, include either



  * a frame from your `tcpdump` output or
  * a line from the `bridge monitor fdb` output or  `brctl showmacs br0` output

  that shows each event occurring. 

  (If the output you include shows more than just that one event, make sure to highlight or otherwise mark the relevant part.)

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Finally, run the [Effect of a smaller collision domain](#effectofasmallercollisiondomain) section of the experiment. Show the `iperf` receiver output both with and without MAC learning.

  Then, run the following variation: With MAC learning turned ON, run an iperf receiver on node-4 (`iperf -s`). On node-1, node-2, and node-3, simultaneously run iperf transmitters to send traffic to node-4 (`iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90`).

  What network capacity is "seen" by each of the three transmitters? Show the relevant output on the iperf receiver, and explain. Explain how and why this is different from the experiment shown in the first 75 seconds of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjjnij3kunI), where MAC learning is also turned on.


### Supplemental activities 


### Effect of a smaller collision domain

Finally, we will observe how a switch or a bridge improves network performance by reducing the number of hosts in each collision domain. Only one host in a collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other hosts listen to the network in order to avoid collisions. Thus, the total network capacity is shared among all hosts on the collision domain.

To measure this effect, we will use `iperf`, a tool that estimates network capacity by trying to send data as quickly as possible over a link, and measuring the total data rate.

To install `iperf`, on each of romeo, juliet, hamlet, and ophelia, run

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install iperf
```

Then, run the `iperf` receiver application on hamlet and ophelia:

```
iperf -s
```

Finally, we will run the `iperf` transmitter to send traffic to each of those. Try to start the two transmitters quickly, one after the other.

On romeo, run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -t 90
```

and on juliet, quickly run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90
```

After a couple of minutes, you should see messages on the two receiver instances, indicating the total data rate in kilobits per second, e.g.

```
[  4]  0.0-97.3 sec  9.88 MBytes   851 Kbits/sec
```

on one, and

```
[  4]  0.0-97.3 sec  9.88 MBytes   851 Kbits/sec
```

on the other.

Now, we will turn off MAC address learning on the bridge (by setting the ageing timeout to 0, so that all forwarding table entries expire immediately):

```
sudo brctl setageing br0 0
```

Without MAC address learning, all frames will be flooded on all ports, and all nodes will be in a single collision domain. The 1000 Kbps capacity will be shared between them.

The `iperf` receivers should still be running on hamlet and ophelia. We will start the transmitters again, one after the other. On romeo, run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -t 90
```

and on juliet, quickly run

```
iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90
```

Now we can see from the measured data rate on each of the two receivers, that the 1000 Kbps link capacity is shared between the two traffic flows.
```
[  5]  0.0-150.8 sec  7.50 MBytes   417 Kbits/sec
```

on one, and

```
[  5]  0.0-130.8 sec  8.88 MBytes   569 Kbits/sec
```

on the other.

To restore MAC address learning, on the bridge run

```
sudo brctl setageing br0 300
```

**Lab report**: Show the `iperf` receiver output both with and without MAC learning.

**Lab report**: Run the following variation: With MAC learning turned ON, run an iperf receiver on ophelia (`iperf -s`). On romeo, juliet, and hamlet, simultaneously run iperf transmitters to send traffic to ophelia (`iperf -c 10.0.0.4 -t 90`). What network capacity is "seen" by each of the three transmitters? Show the relevant output on the iperf receiver, and explain. Explain how and why this is different from the experiment shown in the first 75 seconds of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjjnij3kunI), where MAC learning is also turned on.

### Destination address is not reachable

We can also observe what happens when frames are sent to a destination address that is not connected to the switch. 

First, we will repeat the experiment above, but with a destination address that is not connected to the bridge, and never has been. 

Verify that the bridge only knows local MAC addresses, and wait for non-local addresses (if there are any) to expire. Then, on the bridge, run 

```
bridge monitor fdb
```


on juliet, hamlet, and ophelia, run

```
sudo tcpdump -n -e -i EXPIFACE1
```

and on romeo, run


```
ping -c 5 10.0.0.5
```



Because romeo does not know the MAC address associated with the IP address 10.0.0.5, it sends ARP requests to the broadcast MAC address, ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, asking for the owner of the IP address 10.0.0.5 to reply with its MAC address. These frames with the _broadcast_ MAC address in the destination field are flooded out of all ports, as seen in the `tcpdump` output:



```
18:22:49.844039 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
18:22:50.842626 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
18:22:51.843635 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
18:22:52.862170 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
18:22:53.860613 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
18:22:54.861167 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 42: Request who-has 10.0.0.5 tell 10.0.0.1, length 28
```



We will also observe what would happen to frames with a destination MAC address that is not connected to any switch port, but that is also not a broadcast MAC address. For example, what would happen if juliet was disconnected from the switch?



Verify that the bridge only knows local MAC addresses, and wait for non-local addresses (if there are any) to expire. Then, on the bridge, run 

```
bridge monitor fdb
```


on hamlet and ophelia, run

```
sudo tcpdump -n -e -i EXPIFACE1
```

and on juliet, run

```
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE1 down
```

to bring down the interface on juliet that is connected to the bridge. Finally, on romeo, run


```
ping -c 5 10.0.0.2
```


We can see that all five ping requests, which have as their destination the MAC address of juliet (02:a0:6e:e0:58:93), were flooded out of the ports that hamlet and ophelia are connected to:


```
18:31:50.359797 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 3612, seq 1, length 64
18:31:51.367118 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 3612, seq 2, length 64
18:31:52.375218 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 3612, seq 3, length 64
18:31:53.383385 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 3612, seq 4, length 64
18:31:54.391493 02:cd:b5:11:64:e2 > 02:a0:6e:e0:58:93, ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 98: 10.0.0.1 > 10.0.0.2: ICMP echo request, id 3612, seq 5, length 64
```


Bring the interface on juliet up again by running the following on juliet:

```
sudo ip link set EXPIFACE1 up
```
