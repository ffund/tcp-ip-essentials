## FABRIC-specific instructions: Reserve resources

First, you will reserve a topology that includes a bridge with four ports, and one host connected to each port.

To run this experiment on FABRIC, open the JupyterHub environment on FABRIC, open a shell, and run

```
git clone https://github.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials.git
git checkout wip
```

In the File Browser on the left, first go to the directory "tcp-ip-essentials", and then go to the directory "lab-l2-bridge".

Then open the notebook titled "setup.ipynb".

Follow along inside the notebook to reserve resources and get the login details for each node in the experiment.
