## Cloudlab-specific instructions: Reserve resources

First, you will reserve a topology that includes a bridge with four ports, and one host connected to each port.

To reserve resources on Cloudlab, open this profile page:

https://www.cloudlab.us/p/nyunetworks/education?refspec=refs/heads/learning_switch_22

Click "next", then select the Cloudlab project that you are part of and a Cloudlab cluster with available resources. (This experiment is compatible with any of the Cloudlab clusters.) Then click "next", and "finish".

Wait until all of the sources have turned green and have a small check mark in the top right corner of the "topology view" tab, indicating that they are fully configured and ready to log in. Then, click on "list view" to get SSH login details for the nodes.
